# e-commerce Site

Welcome to my ecommerce site repository, this is a project that I am building with the purpose of learning and practicing how to create a complex Full Stack Web Application from Scratch.
I will be using the projects section in this Github repo to set goals and tasks.

## Initial Stack

- Typescript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with types. I have used typescript with react in the past, but this is the first time I use it on the backend with Express

- React.js: Frontend Framework. I chose this one because it has the highest demand across other frameworks.

- Express.js: Node.js Framework to handle requests and responses.

- Sequelize: ORM (Object Relational Mapping). This tool is used to convert JSON syntax into SQL syntax.

- MySQL: Realational Database

I will add more technologies and tools if necessary

## LISENCE

- MIT License, you can fork or copy this project with no need to contact me
